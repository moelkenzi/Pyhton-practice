Python Programming Basics - Study Notes
1. Number Classification
Explanation: This program helps us understand how numbers can be classified. When a user enters a number:
If it's greater than 0 (like 1, 2, 3...), it's positive
If it's exactly 0, it's neutral
If it's less than 0 (like -1, -2, -3...), it's negative
2. Grade Calculation Systems
Explanation: This grading system shows how to convert numerical marks into letter grades:
90 or above = A
80-89 = B
70-79 = C
60-69 = D
Below 60 = Fail
3. Basic Loops
Explanation: Loops are used to repeat actions:
The program starts counting from 1
It keeps printing numbers until it reaches 10
count += 1 means add 1 to count each time
4. Even/Odd Number Checker
Explanation:
% is called modulus operator
It gives us the remainder after division
If a number divided by 2 has no remainder (% 2 == 0), it's even
If there's a remainder, it's odd
5. Age Category Classification
Explanation: This program categorizes people based on their age:
13 or younger → too young
14-25 → boy
26-50 → man
Over 50 → adult
6. Number Sequence Generators
Explanation: These programs show two ways to generate number sequences:
Increasing: Counts up from start number to end number
Decreasing: Counts down from start number to end number
+= means add to
-= means subtract from
7. Simple Security Check
Explanation: This is a basic security check:
There's a preset secret code ("B5B")
Program asks user to enter the code
If entered code matches exactly → access granted
If not → access denied
Key Programming Concepts Learned:
Input/Output: Using input() to get user data and print() to show results
Variables: Storing and using data
Conditional Statements: Using if, elif, and else for decision making
Loops: Using while for repeated actions
Operators:
Comparison (>, <, >=, <=, ==)
Mathematical (+, -, %)
Data Types: Working with integers, strings, and floating-point numbers
